# Project Title: Automated Section Extraction from Radiology Reports

# Overview
This project aims to enhance the processing of radiology reports by utilizing advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to automatically segment unstructured text into its standard sections . This approach seeks to improve the efficiency of medical documentation and provide clear, structured outputs that can aid in diagnostic processes.

# Objectives
- To develop a machine learning model capable of accurately segmenting radiology reports into their respective sections.
- To implement text representation techniques like TF-IDF and Word2Vec for feature extraction from text data.
- To utilize logistic regression for classification tasks.
- To employ Metaflow for managing data flows and building reproducible machine learning pipelines.

# Technologies Used:
Python: For all programming requirements.
Pandas and Plotly: For data manipulation and visualization.
Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning models and preprocessing techniques.
Gensim: For building and analyzing Word2Vec models.
Metaflow: For building and managing machine learning workflows.
